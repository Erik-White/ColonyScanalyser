# ColonyScanalyser

An image analysis tool for measuring microorganism colony growth.

ColonyScanalyser will analyse and collate statistical data from agar plate images. It provides fast, high-throughput image processing.

<img align="right" src="docs/images/growth_curve_linear_small.png">

ColonyScanalyser can provide information on:
* Colony appearance time
* Growth parameters (lag time, rate, carrying capacity)
* Growth and appearance time distribution
* Colony colour (e.g. staining or other visual indicators)

ColonyScanalyser is suitable for analysing series of images from a fixed point that show the development of microorganism colonies over time.

Several image plots will be output after analysis is complete to enable quick verification of the data. A complete set of data is provided in CSV format for further study.

## Getting Started

* Install the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) and [package](#installing)
* Locate your image series in a folder e.g. `/user/images/series1`
* Run the analysis using ColonyScanalyser
```
scanalyser /user/images/series1
```

There are various command line arguments that can alter the way the package is run. To see a list of arguments and information on each, run the command
```
scanalyser --help
```

### Documentation
A full set of documentation is available at https://erik-white.github.io/ColonyScanalyser/

### Prerequisites
ColonyScanalyser requires Python version 3.7 or greater, and the Pip package manager. Pip is included with Python version 3.4 and up.

The remaining Python package dependencies are automatically handled by Pip when installing the Colonyscanalyser package.
